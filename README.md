2. Financial Relationships:
Operating income, gross profit, and EBITDA are strongly correlated.
No significant relationship exists between EPS, shares outstanding, or year-close price.
3. Debt and Liquidity:
Long-term debt has been decreasing since 2018, but total liabilities have been increasing.
The cash-to-debt ratio has been declining, signaling reduced liquidity.
4. Employee Efficiency:
Revenue and profit per employee have been increasing, indicating improved workforce productivity.
5. Market and Shareholder Insights:
The PE ratio has shown a positive trend since 2018, reflecting investor confidence.
Cash on hand has been declining significantly since 2018, which could limit operational flexibility.
## Recommendations
- Improve Liquidity: Address the declining cash reserves by improving operational cash flow or reducing unnecessary expenditures.
- Monitor Liabilities: Manage the increase in total liabilities to maintain financial stability.
- Leverage Workforce Productivity: Continue investing in employee training and development to sustain the increasing revenue and profit per employee.
- Enhance Shareholder Value: Consider strategies like share buybacks or dividend increases to align EPS and share performance with market expectations.
